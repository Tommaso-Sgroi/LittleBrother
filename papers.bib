	abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a home surveillance system that utilizes computer vision techniques to recognize intrusions and detailed threat information including classifying types of trespassers and specific weapons used. Process of identifying intrusions is achieved by our Smart Intruder Detection and Surveillance System (SIDSS) which involves 3 stages of computer vision algorithms. 3-stage SIDSS includes an optimized convolutional neural network (CNN) for threat and intrusion detections, cascading classifiers for locating any potential intruders with correcting mechanism to overcome undetected threats from the previous stage, and principal component analysis (PCA) to efficiently train the facial recognizer to accurately differentiate passersby from potential intruders. Our system is scalable for various surveillance events and can be expanded with additional pre-processed datasets added to the SIDSS model to manage greater surveillance areas. Through this enhanced configuration, the system can achieve enhanced accuracy of recognizing broad range of weapons used and intruders.},

	abstract = {Automated security systems are a useful addition to today’s home where safety is an important issue. Vision-based security systems have the advantage of being easy to set up, inexpensive and non-obtrusive. This paper proposes an integrated dual-level vision-based home security system, which consists of two subsystems – a face recognition module and a motion detection module. The primary face recognition module functions as a user authentication device. On an event of a failure in the primary system, the secondary motion detection module acts as a reliable backup to detect human-related motions within certain locations inside the home. Novel algorithms have been proposed for both subsystems. Several experiments and field tests conducted have shown good performance and feasible implementation in both subsystems1.},

	abstract = {While the Transformer architecture has become the de-facto standard for natural language processing tasks, its applications to computer vision remain limited. In vision, attention is either applied in conjunction with convolutional networks, or used to replace certain components of convolutional networks while keeping their overall structure in place. We show that this reliance on CNNs is not necessary and a pure transformer applied directly to sequences of image patches can perform very well on image classification tasks. When pre-trained on large amounts of data and transferred to multiple mid-sized or small image recognition benchmarks (ImageNet, CIFAR-100, VTAB, etc.), Vision Transformer (ViT) attains excellent results compared to state-of-the-art convolutional networks while requiring substantially fewer computational resources to train.},

	abstract = {Object detection and Action recognition is one of the key problems in computer vision. Deep learning has gained an enormous influence on how the world is adapting to Artificial Intelligence since the past few years.The project is mainly made for the purpose of security and surveillance. Action recognition is used to monitor the movements of the subject and object detection is used to detect the objects present in the scene.This project is created in the Python programming language with the help of real time computer vision libraries like OpenCv and YOLO. OpenCv is also used for machine learning, and image processing. We have given a dataset of objects which can detect up to 82 objects. OpenCv uses its dnn module to load pre-trained dataset in the code and match it with the data provided by the numpy matrices. Numpy is also a python library used to store the data in arrays. It works by taking the input as a video stream from the webcam/any cam and applying the algorithm on each frame.},
